# EnhancedFitnessTrack-GET FIT

Our project aims to develop an enhanced step counter feature within an existing Kotlin-based Android Fitness App. By utilizing the smartphone's built-in sensors, our application will accurately track a userâ€™s daily step count and provide additional metrics such as distance traveled, and calories burned. The goal is to encourage physical activity through precise tracking and motivational features, such as setting daily goals, progress tracking, and sharing achievements on social media platforms.
